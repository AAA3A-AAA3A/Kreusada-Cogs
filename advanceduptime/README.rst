Advanced Uptime
===============

-------
Outline
-------

This cog is going to show your bot's uptime, with extra information and stats.

---------------------------
How do I download this cog?
---------------------------

Let's firstly add my repository if you haven't already:

* :code:`[p]repo add kreusada https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs`

Next, let's download the cog from the repo:

* :code:`[p]cog install kreusada advanceduptime`

Finally, you can see my end user data statement, cog requirements, and cog information by using:

* :code:`[p]cog info kreusada advanceduptime`

-----
Usage
-----

* :code:`[p]uptime`

You might be wondering, how are you able to use a new uptime command if one already exists?
This cog will replace the core uptime command, and then will add the core uptime command back 
if the :code:`AdvancedUptime` cog is unloaded/uninstalled.

This command's output will provide information on your bot's uptime, your bot's name,
your bot's owner (you), the current discord guild, the number of guilds the bot is present in,
the number of unique users your bot has, and the number of commands available!
