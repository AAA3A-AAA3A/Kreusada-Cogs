## Hello Contributors!

If you are in this folder, you are most likely looking to help contribute towards the documentation.
As a disclaimer, this requires no coding knowledge whatsoever, only partial knowledge of the cog itself.

## How do I get started?

- Head over to the [contributor's template](https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs/blob/master/docs/contributors/contributing.rst) and copy all the text in the file.
- Allocate over to [here](https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs/tree/master/docs) and click add file, then create new file.
- Paste the contributor's template into this file, and make all the necessary edits for the cog you are authoring.
- Name the file as the cog's name you are authoring, followed by `.rst`.
- Scroll down to the bottom and hit propose changes.
- Now you should be at a page where there's a button which says `Create pull request`. Click it and add any additional details in the description.
- You have now created a Pull Request with your documentation. Wait for a reviewer or the QA to make reviews and add comments for changes.

- If you are new to github and get very confused, you can always ask for help with this [here](https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7).

## Contributing Expectations

We'd expect the following from those who contribute towards the documentation:

- Punctual and grammatically correct in their phrasing.
- Concise and certain in what you mean/about the cog.

## Contributing Tips

- Don't try and write about a large cog, unless you know how it works inside out. For those starting out, pick an easy cog to write about.
- If you're unsure about anything we are happy to help you. Join us in the [support server](https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7).

## Contributing Outline

All the Cog Guide documentations will include:

- Installation - How would one download this cog/add kreusada's repo? 
- Outline - Explain what the cog does, what it's about.
- Prerequirements - If applicable. If there are no prerequirements, do not include this field.
- Usage - How would one use this cog? 
- Setup usage - How would one setup this cog if applicable? If setup is not required, do not include this field.
- Support - How would one reach out for support if they need further assistance? (Do not edit this field in the contributor's template.

We have this outline to ensure that our guides stay uniform, and are therefore easier to access certain pockets of information from our readers.

## Where will my contribution go?

Great question! Your cog guide contribution will be published [here](https://kreusadacogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) within 15 minutes of a QA check pull request.
