-----
Standard Information
-----

Demaratus is a Discord development instance endorsed by Red and developed by Kreusada, with assistance from many. Originally named Grandmaster, Demaratus quickly rebranded in its development process. Whilst sharing cogs from the Red core and their third party cog developers, Demaratus also owns its unique features exclusive to this instance. You can find out about all our features by reading the remainder of this documentation.

.. _warning:: Demaratus Documentation is currently in its development process and will remain this way until late January 2021 (Predicted ETA)

-----
Documentation Beta
-----

This documentation is still in its development phase, and will remain this way for quite some time.

-----
Support
-----

The Matrix Development Team is a small group of Discord developers who develop instances as part of their share on Discord. We voluntarily offer our time to support you with your code or instance development. You can join our server just `here <https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7>`_.

Additionally, you can email Kreusada at kreusadaprojects@gmail.com for business enquiries ONLY. 

-----
MDT Staff Notices
-----

It is not tolerated to DM our Staff or Cog Creators at the Matrix Development Team, on the subject of code, demaratus or graphic design. Everything must be kept inside the server for archival purposes. We will not support you in DMs.

**Exclusions**

Currently, we will exclude any code that includes portal tokens. Tokens MUST stay in DMs, and must only be shared with the Staff for your own safety. 

.. note:: We have a ticket feature which is currently being built. When this is complete, tokens can now be shared in tickets, which are shared only with staff. This is again, for archival purposes.

^^^^^^
Grandmaster
^^^^^^

Grandmaster was established on 31/07/2020, and officially expired on 16/10/2020. Its expiration was due to the establishment of GCE Hosting, which would further bolster the development of our instance to provide a better experience for you. 

If you added Grandmaster to your server before 16/10/2020, please read below.

Grandmaster was a completely seperate instance. The difference is, Demaratus remains online simultaneously and has a greater semantic user interface and an improved organisation of cogs. Multiple cogs were scrapped during the switch.
