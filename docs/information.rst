DV1-DV2 Switching
^^^^^^

DV1 (Demaratus Version 1) was established on 31/07/2020, and officially expired on 16/10/2020. Its expiration was due to the establishment of GCE Hosting, which would further bolster the development of our instance to provide a better experience for you. 

If you added Demaratus to your server before 16/10/2020, it's vitally important that you read our notices below to switch to DV2. We will not offer support for DV1, and DV1 will be removed from all servers by 01/01/2021. Additionally, if you are more familiar with our old instance 'Grandmaster', same applies if you were unaware of our rebrand.

DV2 is a completely seperate instance. The difference is, it remains online simultaneously and has a greater semantic user interface and an improved organisation of cogs. Multiple cogs were scrapped during the DV2 switch.

Here are the steps to setting up DV2 in your Discord server:

#1: Remove DV1 from your server. This is optional, but recommended. Nothing bad will happen if you decide to keep it within your server, but this bot is now our development drone.

#2: Invite DV2 to your server. The invite link can be obtained here: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=766580519000473640&scope=bot&permissions=8

#3: Set your moderation announcements. There are two different ways of doing this:

  Follow our announcement channel (#ðŸ”±demaratus-alerts) in the Matrix Development Team. You can join our server here: https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7

  Set an announcement channel in your server: Use ``dem #channel``. This channel will have alerts from Demaratus sent straight to your channel. 

We urge you to consider either of these options, and we advise you set these functions up in moderator or admin only text channels. If you require assistance in this process, let us know in our Development server.
