Standard Information

Demaratus is a Discord development instance endorsed by Red and developed by Kreusada, with assistance from many. Originally named Grandmaster, Demaratus quickly rebranded in its development process. Whilst sharing cogs from the Red core and their third party cog developers, Demaratus also owns its unique features exclusive to this instance. You can find out about all our features by reading the remainder of this documentation.

.. _warning:: Demaratus Documentation is currently in its development process and will remain this way until late January 2021 (Predicted ETA)

Documentation Beta

This documentation is still in its development phase, and will remain this way for quite some time.
