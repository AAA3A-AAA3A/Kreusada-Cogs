AdvancedUptime
====================

-------
Outline
-------

:code:`AdvancedUptime` is a cog that allows users to get their bot's uptime inside an embed, with some additional 'fancy' info!
This cog will remove the :code:`uptime` command from your redbot's core, instead replacing it with :code:`AdvancedUptime`'s :code:`uptime` command.

.. attention:: Not happy with the output from :code:`AdvancedUptime`? No problem, just unload the cog and you will have the original uptime command back from your redbot core.

------------
Installation
------------

Make sure you have :code:`Downloader` loaded!

:code:`[p]load Downloader`
