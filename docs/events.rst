Demaratus Events
================

Chaos is always prominent in the life of Demaratus. Those who turn against him have been punished. Those who overthrow him have been underthrown. Those who help us to defend against his trepidity, rejuvenate the trust and immortalise the mortals. In this section of our documentation, you will be able to look through all of our events, find out how to take part, and find out all the lovely stories behind it. We also refer to them as ``demevents``.

Demaratus Event 1: Lost Treasures of Kanermetus
-----------------------------------------------

The plan was to collect the universe's entities, to rejoice in power against the mortals in our existence. However, three of our entities absconded from my grasp, dispersing across Planet Earth. Recently, I discovered that these entities were owned by Kanermetus, who seems to bear every entity I attempt to claim for myself. All my entities are stored in a secret chamber, locked away. Kanermetus shouldn't be able to get his hands on them - but I need your help! I cannot keep these entities forever, before they are stolen and prized by the piece of filth I wish to speak of no more! I invite you to join me in protecting and finding these treasures, but I warn you mortals, help Kanermetus and you will be punished!

**Demaratus Event 1: Lost Treasures of Kanermetus** is a Demaratus Event where you have to search for coins inside commands, and hand them to their righteous owners. Will you be handing your discovered coins to Demaratus, or to Kanermetus? Demaratus warns you!

For more information, you can visit my `support server <https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7>`_ and ask your questions in ``ðŸ‘¾support-demaratus``.

This event is destined to begin before the beginning of December.
