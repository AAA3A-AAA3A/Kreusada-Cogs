Updated ToS
-----------

Support from the lead developer is limited due to personal life. The Staff or Support Squad should be able to satisfy your needs.

We now require for you to remove our V1 Demaratus from your server. It should now identify as KreusadaTesting, and will only be used for testing in the development server. This bot has no additional features, and actually functions unreliably in comparison to Demaratus.

If you have not yet removed this bot, it will be removed over the coming months. These are the servers that KreusadaTesting is currently present in:
