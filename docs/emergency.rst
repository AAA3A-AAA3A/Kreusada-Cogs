Crystal Outage
==============

Dear user,

I hugely appreciate you coming to take a look and see where you can contribute. Please allow me to explain. The majority of our images were taken from ``auntm.ai``, and they are therefore hosted images. This means that the ``auntm.ai`` developer, Kelldor, is being charged real money for our crystal command! This is not okay, and we must act on it seriously. As a result, I have removed all of the auntm.ai links from the `champion dictionary. <https://github.com/kreus7/demaratus/blob/master/mcoc/crystal.py>`_

There are still champions available in ``crystals``, but a lot have been removed. And my objective is to add all the champions back to the crystals. This issue will consequently delay the release of roster.

How can you help?
-----------------

1. Join our `support server. <https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7>`_

2. Take a look at the `champion dictionary. <https://github.com/kreus7/demaratus/blob/master/mcoc/crystal.py>`_

3. If a ``#`` appears before a champion in the list, it means that the URL is from ``auntm.ai``. This is where you can help out:

4. If you spot a champion with a ``#`` before their name, get a featured image of them. This can be obtained from ``auntm.ai``!

5. Paste the featured image into a text channel, and then right click and **copy link**.

6. Send this link to our contributors channel in our support server, with the champion's name of whom it belongs to.

7. The image is no longer hosted by ``auntm.ai``. It is instead hosted by Discord, so we're good to go!

Any more information needed? You can contact **Kreusada** privately.
