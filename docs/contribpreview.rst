-------
Outline
-------

Explain here what the cog is, what it does, maybe even why it might be useful to the user.

---------------
Prerequirements
---------------

As far as I know, none of my cogs so far contain prerequirements. However, if the cog you are documenting does require some prequirements, be sure to mention them here.
If you are unsure, feel free to reach out to Kreusada on Discord.

------------
Installation
------------

Make sure you have :code:`Downloader` loaded!

:code:`[p]load Downloader`

Let's add Kreusada's repository firstly:

:code:`[p]repo add kreusadacogs https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs`

Now, you can add the :code:`CogName` cog into your system.

:code:`[p]cog install kreusadacogs cogname`

------
Usage
------

How would someone use the cog? Do not include the setup here. You can use :code:`small code blocks` to reference snippets of code.

You can also reference large pieces of code with it's corresponding programming language as such:

.. code-block:: python

    import discord
    from redbot.core import commands
    ...
    
You may also use the following blocks to highlight important information:

.. note:: This will appear as a blue note block in the documentation.

.. tip:: This will appear as a green tip block in the documentation.

.. attention:: This will appear as an orange attention block in the documentation.

.. warning:: This will appear as an orange warning block in the documentation.

-----------
Setup Usage
-----------

Here you can include information on how to setup the cog/its config. Remember, you can still use all the syntax shown above to explain the setup.

**You can also use sub-headers as boldened text like this.**

-------

As always, you can join my `support server <https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7>`_ if you need help!
