This documentation was built to allow users to acquire a greater depth around Demaratus. The bot has a lot of features, so providing you with a user manual would be useful, right? This document was established 10/10/2020, and is currently being constructed as we speak. The full document was coded and scripted by Kreusada. You can find all the code and RSTs at his github repository (/docs): github.com/KREUSADA/kreusadacogs/edit/master/docs.
