This is the cog guide for all commands for Marvel Contest of Champions. Whilst this cog is HUGE, and still being developed, we wanted to give you early access to some of our features. You must understand that there might be issues, or maintenance, here or there. We test all our features on Admetus (Our testing drone) before releasing them onto Demaratus.

.. note:: For the user help manual, you should consider typing ``,help Mcoc``

.. warning:: A few of our features are currently in the ``find`` cog. Support for these features is still included although its not part of the cog.

Crystal

``Crystal`` is one of our most significant features which people seem to be enjoying! Its fairly straightforward to use, and we are adding some new features soon.

**Syntax**

.. code-block:: none
,crystal

That is generally all you have to type. Then, a random champion will be displayed inside an embed, as their featured image.

.. warning:: This is due to change in the upcoming months. We are adding different crystal types, with different champion rarities.

Champ

``Champ`` is used to bring up champion images.

**Syntax: champ featured**

.. code-block:: none
,champ featured <champion>

This will bring up the featured image of a champion.

.. warning:: This command is currently down for maintenance. I am doing my best to get it back to normal.

**Syntax: champ portrait**

.. code-block:: none
,champ portrait <champion>

This will bring up the portrait image of a champion. This command is good to go!
