Playing music inside Voice Chats is such an awesome feature to have. Luckily, with Demaratus, we have this feature ready for you to use! In this documentation, you will find a full guide on how to use ``Audio`` in your server!

.. warning:: Unfortunately, our Spotify API token is currently depleted, we are doing our best to re-enable Spotify for you!

.. warning:: In extremely rare cases, the Lavalink server may crash. In this case, the ``Audio`` commands will not be usable. If you receive an alert saying that Lavalink has crashed, please report it to the Staff at the Matrix Development Team.

Further Support
-----

Audio is really easy to use! The commands listed in this document are only some of the commands available. There are many more, which you can access using ``!help Audio``

.. warning:: Remember to captitalise the ``A`` in ``!help Audio``. It is the name of a cog (category of commands) and therefore needs to be captitalised at the start of the word.

For further ``Audio`` support, we're happy to help. Come and ask your questions in the Matrix Development Team. You can join our server here: https://discord.gg/JmCFyq7
