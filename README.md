  KreusadaCogs - V3 Cogs for Red-DiscordBot
  <br>
</h1>

This is my repository for Red Discord-Bot. I built these cogs because these were the features that I wanted for my bot, [WALL-E.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=766580519000473640&scope=bot&permissions=8)

## Alerts

I am a student, just a year away from taking exams - I also have a large sporting and social life. By creating an issue or pull request,
you understand that support may not arrive instantly, and feature requests may be turned down sheerly due to the fact that I do not
have the patience or time to cover these ideas.

## Installation

Primarily, make sure you have `downloader` loaded. 

    `[p]load Downloader`

Next, let's add my repository to your system.

    `[p]repo add kreusadacogs https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs`

Finally, you can load cogs from my repo by executing the following command:

    `[p]cog install kreusadacogs <cog>`

Remember - don't include the `<>` when you use this command. Those characters are just to show you where to enter the cog name.

## In the event of Red V4

Red V4 is most definitely inevitable, which would mean every cog here would become infunctionable until they receive a rewrite.
Some of these cogs will not be receiving rewrites. Some cogs will be maintained with updates until it reaches a point where the majority of users have migrated to V4.
