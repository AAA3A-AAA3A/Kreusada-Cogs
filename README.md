  KreusadaCogs - V3 Cogs for Red-DiscordBot
  <br>
</h1>

This is my repository for Red Discord-Bot. I built these cogs because these were the features that I wanted for my bot, [WALL-E.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=766580519000473640&scope=bot&permissions=8)

## Installation
Primarily, make sure you have `downloader` loaded. 

    `[p]load Downloader`

Next, let's add my repository to your system.

    `[p]repo add kreusadacogs https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs`

Finally, you can load cogs from my repo by executing the following command:

    `[p]cog install kreusadacogs <cog>`

Remember - don't include the `<>` when you use this command. Those characters are just to show you where to enter the cog name.
