Redbot cogs for Red-DiscordBot authored by Kreusada
===================================================

This is my repository for Red Discord-Bot. I built these cogs because these were the features that I wanted for my bot, `WALL-E. <https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=766580519000473640&scope=bot&permissions=8>`_

------------
Installation
------------

Primarily, make sure you have `downloader` loaded. 

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]load Downloader

Next, let's add my repository to your system.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]repo add kreusadacogs https://github.com/kreus7/kreusadacogs

Finally, you can load cogs from my repo by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]cog install kreusadacogs <cog>

Remember - don't include the `<>` when you use this command. Those characters are just to show you where to enter the cog name.
