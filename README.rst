Redbot cogs for Red-DiscordBot authored by Kreusada
===================================================

This is my repository for Red Discord-Bot. I built these cogs because these were the features that I wanted for my bot, `WALL-E. <https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=766580519000473640&scope=bot&permissions=8>`_

------------
