Hello, these are the cogs I built for Red-DiscordBot.


------------
Installation
------------

Primarily, make sure you have `downloader` loaded.

    [p]load downloader

Next, let's add my repository to your system.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]repo add kreusada https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs

To install a cog, use this command, replacing <cog> with the name of the cog you wish to install:

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]cog install kreusada <cog>

Contributing

If its a small PR, go for it. Otherwise, unless you've been given the green light, I don't want any big
PRs for the time being: I don't have enough sufficient time to review them.
