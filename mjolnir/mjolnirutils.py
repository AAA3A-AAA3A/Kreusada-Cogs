  "Clouds overcome the sky as thunder and lightning reign over the surrounding area. The thunderous booms demand silence of all other sounds. Effortlessly, gracefully, your mind empties as you grip the handle of the hammer. Your hear the voice of Thor speak to you, as you feel lightning run through your veins. The power of a god is in your hands now, and you are who controls it. As you open your eyes, you feel as though you have been in a dream all your life. You have awakened, the god in you has awakened, the power of Thor is yours to command. Use it wisely."

  "The future is bright for you, Summoner",
  "You aren't worthy yet, but don't give up!",
  "The power of a god is not yet yours to control!"
